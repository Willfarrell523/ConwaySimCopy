# Conway's Simulation of Life


This is a simulation that has cells evolve through generations. Whether or not a cell survives, reproduces, or dies is determined by a set of rules. From the wikipedia page: 

"The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction."

Originally a console based program, I made it a GUI in which the user can interact with the cells as the simulation runs. By clicking on a dead cell, the user can bring it to life. This is an easy way to create very interesting patterns which can be seen on the wikipedia page. 

Unfortunately this project was a time crunch so there is very poor documentation and commenting.
